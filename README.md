# Data-Cleaning-With-T-SQL
## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

This project is a data cleaning project focused on Nashville housing data. The data set includes information about house prices and owner specifications.

The data was cleaned using T-SQL, a programming language used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. The cleaning process involved removing duplicate records, correcting misspelled names, converting data types, and filling in missing values,Breaking out Address into Individual Columns

The cleaned data set is available in the 'cleaned_data' folder of this repository. The data is stored in a CSV file format for easy access and analysis.

The purpose of this project is to provide a clean and reliable data set for further analysis and modeling. The cleaned data set can be used to build predictive models or to gain insights into Nashville's housing market.

Feel free to use this data set for your own analysis or to contribute to the project by suggesting additional cleaning techniques or analysis methods.
